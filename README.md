# Diabetes-Prediction-Model-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
A machine learning model built to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on factors like age, BMI, and glucose levels. The project uses algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest for classification. The model is evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix metrics.
